## About
This project demonstrates **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** in Python by implementing a simple Sweet Shop Management System.  
The system allows adding sweets, placing orders, and managing stock.  
Itâ€™s built with **clean, modular code**, fully covered by unit tests, and includes an interactive runner script.

## Features
- Add sweets with price and stock
- Place orders for one or more sweets
- Automatically updates stock after orders
- Handles errors: ordering unavailable sweets or insufficient stock
- TDD implementation: tests written first, then code
- Interactive runner script to demo the system
